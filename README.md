This project is about infectious diseases and applying our understanding of how the susceptible, infectious, and recovery rates change from disease to disease. By applying our previous knowledge of topics such as ODEs, Interpolation, Least Squares, and Fourier Analysis we can better understand how these diseases spread from person to person and how recovery rates are affected by transmission rates and susceptibility rates. By developing and writing the code for each method we can then simulate how they spread and from there we can interpret the results to learn how and why they change.
