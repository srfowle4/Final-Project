This project is about infectious diseases and applying our understanding of how the susceptible, infectious, and recovery rates change
from disease to disease. Specifically, we will be using an SIR model which describes an infectious disease by diving a population into
three categories: Susceptible, infected, and recovered. Each of these is described using an ordinary differential equation (ODE) and
their combination describes how a diseaes transmits across a population.

By applying our previous knowledge of topics such as ODEs, Interpolation, Least Squares, and Fourier Analysis we can better understand
how these diseases spread from person to person and how recovery rates are affected by transmission rates and susceptibility rates. By
developing and writing the code for each method we can then simulate how they spread and from there we can interpret the results to
learn how and why they change.
